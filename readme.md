# Huffman Block Coding – Group F (TOR3 Class Project)

This project implements Huffman coding using 2-letter blocks for data compression. The script generates a random sequence of 1000 symbols, builds non-overlapping blocks, constructs a Huffman tree based on block frequencies, encodes the data, and verifies correctness through decoding. Keep in mind that this implementation only uses 6 symbols ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'f') with fixed probabilties.

## 🔧 Features

- Random sequence generation
- 2-symbol block construction
- Huffman encoding and decoding
- Compression ratio and average codeword length calculation
- Validation of decoding accuracy

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python huffman_block_coding.py
```

#### Output includes:

- Huffman codes
- Encoded bitstream (preview)
- Compression stats
- Decoding validation
